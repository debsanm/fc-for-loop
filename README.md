# Assignment-1. Write a program that asks the user to enter today’s sales for five stores. The program should then display a bar graph comparing each store’s sales. Create each bar in the bar graph by displaying a row of asterisks.
 Each asterisk should represent $100 of sales.
Here is an example of the program’s output:

Enter today's sales for store 1: 1000 [Enter]

Enter today's sales for store 2: 1200 [Enter]

Enter today's sales for store 3: 1800 [Enter]

Enter today's sales for store 4: 800 [Enter]

Enter today's sales for store 5: 1900 [Enter]


SALES BAR CHART

(Each * = $100)

Store 1: **********

Store 2: ************

Store 3: ******************

Store 4: ********

Store 5: *******************












# Assignment-2.  Write a program whose input is two integers, and whose output is the first integer and subsequent increments of 5 as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:

-15 10
the output is:

-15 -10 -5 0 5 10

Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:

20 5
the output is:

Second integer can't be less than the first.

For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last.
